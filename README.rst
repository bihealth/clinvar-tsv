Clinvar-TSV
===========

This project allows to download ClinVar files and convert them into easy-to-use TSV files.
The project is based on the from by `macarthurlab/clinvar <https://github.com/macarthur-lab/clinvar>`_.
As the latter is Python 2 only and unmaintained, we decided tot reimplement large parts of it using Python 3.
